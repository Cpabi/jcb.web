                    <h3>STARTUP PITFALLS</h3>
                    <P>The client is a startup construction company that phenomenally grew on its third year. Like most startups, the principal owners were more focused on operations and marketing. 
                    As financial transactions grew in volume, the companyâ€™s accounting staff of two had weak financial controls and neglected reporting / regulatory compliance.</P> 
                
                    <p>On its fourth year, the company received LOAs from the BIR, employees complained that their SSS and Pag-Ibig contributions were not updated. This came as a surprise to the owners because they regularly signed the corresponding checks intended for that purpose. 
                    To make matters worse, the company found it difficult to renew its construction license with the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) because of tax delinquencies.</p>

                    <p>JCB & Associates Inc. came in to assess the situation. They assisted the company in the BIR cases, updated the mandatory contributions and implemented financial controls to avoid a repeat of the said incidents. The consultants provided the accounting staff with tax compliance training and regularly monitored their performance.
                    In the end, the principal owners and entire staff were happy with the results. The company now concentrates on its core competence of marketing and operations as it continues to grow profitably.
